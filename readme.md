                                   History of java script


```                                      
               JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was   
               developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 
               standard in 1997. After Netscape handed JavaScript over 
               to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop 
               JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest  version was 1.8
